## 📚 About Me

I'm a **Computer Science & Mathematics** student at Menoufia University with a focus on **information security**. Currently working as an Information Security Analyst at DEPI, where I gained hands-on experience in SOC operations, security monitoring, and incident response.

I completed my cybersecurity training at **ITI (Information Technology Institute)**, where I learned the fundamentals of ethical hacking, penetration testing, and defensive security.

## 🚀 Featured Project: Mini SOC Environment

**Sep 2025 - Nov 2025 | DEPI Graduation Project**

As part of the DEPI program, I worked on a team project to build a fully functional **Mini Security Operations Center (SOC)** that simulates real-world enterprise security monitoring.

### 🎯 Key Achievements

**1. Designed Enterprise-Grade Network Architecture**
- Implemented **3-zone network segmentation** (SIEM, Victims, Attacker)
- Configured pfSense firewall with routing, DHCP, NAT, and firewall rules
- Deployed Snort IDS for network-level intrusion detection

**2. Built Centralized Security Monitoring**
- Deployed Wazuh SIEM to collect and correlate logs from multiple sources
- Integrated logs from pfSense, Windows, Linux, and web applications
- Configured Wazuh agents for endpoint visibility

**3. Developed Custom Detection Use Cases**
- Created **3 correlated detection rules** combining NIDS + EDR:
  - **RDP Brute Force**: Correlated Snort alerts with Windows Event ID 4625
  - **SQL Injection**: Correlated Snort signatures with Apache access logs
  - **XSS Attack**: Correlated network patterns with successful HTTP 200 responses
- Achieved **100% detection coverage** with zero false positives

**4. Performed Real-World Attack Simulations**
- Executed controlled attacks from Kali Linux (RDP brute-force, SQLi, XSS, Nmap scans)
- Validated all detections across network and endpoint layers
- Documented complete attack timelines and incident analysis

**5. Mapped Detections to MITRE ATT&CK**
- Aligned all detected activities to MITRE ATT&CK techniques
- Created structured threat intelligence mappings
- Documented IOCs and incident response playbooks

**6. Delivered Complete SOC Documentation**
- Wrote 67-page comprehensive project documentation
- Included use case development, alert triage workflows, and RCA
- Defined SOC KPIs and maturity assessment

### 📊 Results
- **Detection Rate**: 100% (all attacks detected)
- **False Positives**: 0
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**: ~5 seconds
- **Alert Quality**: High-fidelity correlated alerts

**Tech Stack**: pfSense, Snort IDS, Wazuh SIEM, Kali Linux, Windows, DVWA, VMware
